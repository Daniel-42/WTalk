# WTalk
Google Talk like client for Windows

## Summary
Client library and desktop client for Google Hangouts written in c#
Based on Tom Dryer python library.

This project is new and needs many improvement (perf / features) 

ProtoJson parser is inspired by Marc Gravell work on ProtoBuf-net, and it can be improved.

This is more a proof of concept than a real app.

Final goal is to have a hangout client on windows phone and a very simple client on windows (like gtalk was).

## Initial project
Port of https://github.com/tdryer/hangups to c#.
